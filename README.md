### Hi! :mechanical_arm: You found my github--

I'm a data scientist focused on biology, education, and health! I have a masters in biology, spent way too long in a PhD program for evolutionary biology, and an OG Lambda school alumnus. 

For a better look at my projects, check out my [portfolio](https://jae-finger.github.io/)!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about python data manipulation via [Effective Pandas](https://store.metasnake.com/effective-pandas-book)
